# âš¡ pwrui

Still in its early stages, pwrui is intended to grow into a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use framework for building interactive [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) applications.  
While pwrui is best used in applications based on [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) (framework), most of its basic components can be used in any environment.
